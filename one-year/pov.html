    <h1>My Point of View</h1>
    <p>
      this section is all about what my point of view has been over the last
      year. <br>
      this might be a little long so its okay if u dont read it all !

      <p>
          soooooo, my side of the story begins when u replied to my story for the first time on october 26th of last year. <br>
        i had no idea that replying to u would lead me here. one year in and very much in love :)) <br>
        it took me a little while to come around and to say i love you back, i wanted to be sure that i did !! <br>
        and once i realized that i did love you, that was it. girl i was gone. I LITERALLY FOLDED- <br>
        anyways.. fast forward a couple of months and we got into our first argument/misunderstanding of our relationship.<br>
        i remember crying for a few days straight because i didnt know what to do, but what i did know is that i needed u to stay.<br>
        and so i fought for it, i fought for us because i didnt want to let such a good thing go to waste. <br>
        and im very happy that i did, that we both did. because of that i found my person, i found the person i want to go home to. <br>
        ahem.. then after that, it was several months of being very much in love (and we still are hehe)<br>
        weve gotten into a few misunderstandings and obstacles but, in my opinion, they mean nothing compared to everything else.<br>
        for the past year, weve gone through a lot, both as a couple and just as individuals. but one thing is for sure, i dont regret any of it.<br>
        ive been through a lot this year and being able to talk to u and spend time with u, made every day so much easier. <br>
        i can do it on my own, ofc i can ako pa. but having u there was a comforting reminder that someone with a heart like yours loves me<br>
        just as much as i love you. ive said it before, but through your best and worst times, through your ups and down, i will love you unconditionally.<br>
        i know that im not as public about us as much, and i know weve talked about it before, but i really dont care what other people think<br>
        or what they see. the most important thing to me is that YOU know that i love you. ofc i dont mind showing u off because damn, have u seen urself??<br>
        (especially in a nice polo but anyways) thats the most important thing to me. <br>
        sometimes i fear that u dont feel appreciated or like i dont want to tell people about you.<br>
        but ofc i do !!! i have such an amazing girlfriend and i want everyone in the world to know ! its just i know how people are and everyone is too nosy these days.<br>
        theres not a single person that i wouldve rather spent this last year with. if theyre not u, i dont want themðŸ˜¤.<br>
        i could write more and go on and on about how much i love you, but then u wont be able to see the other sections :((<br>
        I LOVE YOU SOSOSOSOSO MUCH AND HAPPY ONE YEAR TO US MY LOVE !!! AND TO MANY MOREEEEEEE (u have no choice, ure stuck with me)<br>
        okie ill see u in the other secitons, I LOVE YOU AND NEVER FORGET THAT !
