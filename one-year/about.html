            i started making this october 14th of this year, i was actually
            scared i wouldn't get it done in time.. <br />but here we are ! so
            if ure seeing this i actually managed to finish it, even though
            school is kicking my ass rn but its okay. hopefully i was a good
            girlfriend and bought u something and not just this website, but i
            hope u like it !<br />
            i was so tempted to tell u what i was doing anytime u asked, but it
            had to be a surprise ! <br />
            ill save all the cheesy stuff for the other sections but uhm
